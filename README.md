# InnerSource Community Toolkit

If you are starting an InnerSource Community, whether it is an internal activity, a region-specific community, or a specific business-to-business sharing group, you will need a toolkit. 
Fortunately, InnerSource Commons has them. This toolkit is just what you need to get started in your InnerSource community.
